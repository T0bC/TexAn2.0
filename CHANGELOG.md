# Changelog

## [2026.9] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- **Boxplot plot type**: New boxplot option in the plotting module with interactive layers and optional overlaid scatter points
- **Violin plot type**: New violin plot option with density visualization and optional overlaid scatter points
- **Plot type selector**: Dropdown to switch between scatter, boxplot, and violin plot types; appears when an X-axis grouping variable is selected
- **Black points option**: Toggle to render overlaid scatter points in black (instead of group colors) for boxplot and violin plots, improving readability when color is already used for grouping
- **Plot-type-specific settings panels**: Style and stat options panels now show only the controls relevant to the selected plot type
- **Independent alpha controls**: When "Boxplot with points" or "Violin with points" is selected, the single Alpha input splits into separate "Alpha Points" and "Alpha Box" controls, allowing independent transparency for the scatter layer and the box/violin fill
- **Median & Mean point markers**: New "Median Point" (◆) and "Mean Point" (⊕) checkboxes in the "Median & SD Lines" accordion overlay per-group summary markers on all plot types; markers are always black with fixed shapes (pch 18 / pch 13)
- **Median & SD lines extended to box/violin+points**: The existing Median crossbar and SD errorbar overlays are now available for "Boxplot with points" and "Violin with points" in addition to scatter; line thickness/width controls are now visible for all plot types
- **Stats legend**: When Legend Position is set to anything other than "none" and at least one stat overlay is active, a separate "Stats" legend box is rendered on the plot listing only the currently enabled overlays (Median line, SD, Median point, Mean point) with correct glyphs

### Changed

- Scatter points are now rendered beneath boxplot and violin layers for improved visual clarity
- **Statistics checkboxes unified**: The "Median" and "SD" checkboxes in Legend & Grid are now shown for all plot types (previously scatter-only); defaults are automatically set to Median + SD checked for scatter and violin+points, and unchecked for boxplot and boxplot+points
- **Median & SD Lines accordion**: Thickness and width controls are no longer hidden for non-scatter plot types

## [2026.8] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- **Plotting style module**: Unicode symbol previews added to shape dropdown choices for visual representation of R `pch` shapes 0–25
- **Plotting style module**: Custom shape mapping support with per-group shape dropdowns; dropdowns disable automatically when the shape-by aesthetic is active
- **Plotting style module**: Drag-and-drop factor ordering with nested sortable tree UI for multi-level X-axis groupings, with integrated color pickers per group
- **Plotting style module**: Color pickers display hex value input with a visible color swatch add-on for improved visibility
- **Dependencies**: `sortable` package added for drag-and-drop functionality

## [2026.7] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- **Plotting filter module**: "All / None" toggle link added to each checkbox group label in the filter sidebar, allowing users to select or deselect all levels of a metadata column in a single click

## [2026.6] - 2026-05-11

### Changed

- **File upload limit**: Increased maximum upload size for `.xlsx` and `.csv` files from the previous limit to **600 MB**

### Fixed

- **Statistics module**: Added immediate UI feedback when clicking "Compute Statistics" — users now see a toast notification and progress bar regardless of which statistical approach is selected, preventing the app from appearing frozen during long computations

## [2026.5] - 2026-05-05

### Changed

- **Plotting module**: Plot cards are no longer horizontally resizable; width is fixed at 100% of the container
- **Plot resize handle** (`index.js`): Drag-to-resize is vertical-only (height), with a minimum height of 150 px and double-click reset to 35 % viewport height
- **Plot card layout** (`plotting.R`): `girafeOutput` uses `height = "auto"` and `width = "100%"` inside a `responsive-plot` wrapper, ensuring plots fill available width without manual horizontal adjustment

## [2026.4] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- **Power Analysis module** — New submodule for planning sample sizes and estimating statistical power for 1-way, 2-way, and 3-way factorial ANOVA designs
- **Three solve modes** — Compute *Sample Size*, *Power*, or *Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)* from the remaining two parameters
- **Three statistical approaches** — Parametric (F-distribution via `pwr` package), Robust (Monte Carlo with trimmed means / Welch ANOVA), and Non-Parametric (Monte Carlo with Kruskal-Wallis rank test)
- **Standardized and raw effect size input** — Enter Cohen's *f* directly or specify group means and SDs; the tool converts raw inputs to Cohen's *f* automatically
- **Median + IQR input mode** — Alternative raw input using medians and IQRs, with distribution-aware conversion to mean/SD parameters for normal, log-normal, and exponential distributions
- **Multi-distribution support** — Normal, log-normal, and exponential data-generating distributions for simulation; non-normal distributions automatically trigger Monte Carlo fallback
- **Import from Data mode** — Load pilot or completed study data in the Load Data module and import its factor structure, group means, SDs, sample sizes, and Cohen's *f* directly into the power module; distribution shape auto-detected via Shapiro-Wilk test
- **Three import workflows** — Pilot-to-full study planning (recommended sample size for full study), post-hoc power analysis (achieved power of a completed study), and sensitivity analysis (MDE given actual sample size)
- **Power curve visualization** — Interactive plot showing power vs. sample size with target power and computed *n* markers; both parametric and simulation-based curve generation supported
- **Simulated data preview** — Scatter plot of expected group data pattern based on configured parameters
- **Design table output** — Summary of *N* per cell for 1-way designs and total *N* for factorial designs
- **Binary search for sample size and MDE** — Efficient bisection algorithm (max n = 500, f range 0.01–2.0) with convergence warnings when target power is unachievable
- **Progress reporting** — Scaled progress callbacks for long-running Monte Carlo computations
- **Input validation** (`validate.R`) — Comprehensive checks for alpha, power target, group counts, effect size, distribution compatibility, and simulation parameters
- **Factor name sanitization** — Strips special characters and ensures unique factor/level names to prevent R formula parsing errors
- **Comprehensive help documentation** for Power Analysis module — Overview, Details (with import mode workflows, effect size guidance, statistical approach comparison, and best practices), and FAQ

## [2026.2] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed

- **Modified Z-Score outlier detection**: Corrected double-scaling bug where the 0.6745 constant was applied on top of an already-scaled MAD (constant=1.4826). Now uses raw MAD with proper 0.6745 scaling per Iglewicz & Hoaglin (1993)
- **Adjusted Boxplot outlier detection**: Corrected exponential coefficients to match Hubert & Vandervieren (2008). Changed from (-3.5, 4) / (-4, 3.5) to correct values (-4, 3) / (-3, 4) for MC ≥ 0 and MC < 0 respectively
- Fixed unclosed HTML `<details>` tag in plotting FAQ causing nested collapsible sections
